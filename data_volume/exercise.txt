2. Add a small application to the docker image which writes
	some data to the disk.

	second.
3. use docker data volumes to make sure that the application
	writes to a data volume
4. Run the docker images as a container for 20 seconds.
5. Kill the container.
6. check the data volume to see that you have data from 20 seconds
	of operation.
